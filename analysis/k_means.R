## the purpose of this file is to try K means clustering with five cohorts 

# load data from five cohorts and merge 

jhs<- readRDS(paste0(path_cleaned_folder,"/jhs.RDS"))

# subset to new DM, run the "DM define" R file 



# merge data  


# scale 


# choose number of clusters, using elbow method (within cluster sum of squares) or Silhouette score 

# run cluster with set seed and #of clusters determined above 

# visualize results
