# o INT: Interim (unscheduled) visits.
# o CON: Confirmation visits to confirm or not-confirm diabetes status; usually completed within 6 weeks of the trigger visit.
# o POV: Primary outcome visits completed after glucose confirmation. Note: Data collected at primary outcome visits included all data that were not collected at the visit where the participantâ€™s glucose was first elevated (trigger visit).
# o WOV: washout visits (washout data only)
# o WCV: washout confirmation visits (washout data only)
