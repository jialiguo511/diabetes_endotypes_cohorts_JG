# o INT: Interim (unscheduled) visits.
# o CON: Confirmation visits to confirm or not-confirm diabetes status; usually completed within 6 weeks of the trigger visit.

# o WOV: washout visits (washout data only)
# o WCV: washout confirmation visits (washout data only)

# Visit coding changed from DPP to DPPOS.

# During DPPOS however, visits were coded as Annual (corresponding to the approximate month and day of randomization) 
# or Mid-year during each calendar year of DPPOS allowing for a 2-month window around each visit. 
# Thus visits occurred at the following time ranges:
